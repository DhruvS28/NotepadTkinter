This was a quick project to learn GUI integration in Python using Tkinter.

Notepad Features:

	- Any text or html files within the directory of the python file will be automatically displayed on the app.
	- Any number of new notes can be added on the app, but only those that are "saved" will be permanent
	- Renaming an app in the app will also rename it in the file directory if it exists there

Future Potential Features:
	- A priority management option to organize specific notes
	- Allowing the choice of a specific colour to notes to signify priority or organization
